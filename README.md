# üëã Welcome to Liquibase!
Liquibase Secure (formerly Liquibase Pro) is database change management made easy. This repository contains links to documentation, sample files, and tips for evaluating Liquibase. This evaluation is intended for people interested in learning about the capabilities of Liquibase Secure.


# üìí Liquibase Documentation
* [Documentation Home](https://docs.liquibase.com/home.html)
* [Liquibase University](https://learn.liquibase.com/)

# üîß Installing Liquibase Secure
Liquibase Secure can be [installed locally](https://www.liquibase.com/download-secure) on Windows, Mac, or Linux platforms (e.g., a workstation or automation tool agent/runner) or invoked using our [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/liquibase/liquibase-secure).

To apply your license key, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/get-started-5-0/apply-your-liquibase-secure-license-key).

# üí° Liquibase Secure Concepts
If you are unfamilar with Liquibase, here is some information to get you started.

* [Changeset](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/user-guide-5-0/what-is-a-changeset): basic unit of database work
* [Changelog](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/user-guide-5-0/what-is-a-changelog): text file containing collection of changesets
* [Tracking tables](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/user-guide-5-0/what-is-the-databasechangelog-table): tables created and maintained by Liquibase

Changelog formats can be mixed and matched as desired. Liquibase does not impose any file name requirements.

# üìÇ Sample Changelogs
* [Root - Mongo - JS](changelog.mongo.json)
    * [JS - Mongo](changesets/changelog.mongo.js)
* [Root - Mongo - XML](changelog.mongo.xml)
    * [JS - Mongo](changesets/changelog.mongo.js)
* [Root - SQL](changelog.relational.sql)
    * [SQL - Relational](changesets/changelog.ddl.sql)
* [Root - XML](changelog.relational.xml)
    * [XML - Relational](changesets/changelog.ddl.xml)
```

# üíª Database Connections
Liquibase supports over [60 databases](https://www.liquibase.com/supported-databases), including data warehouses, relational, and NoSQL.

A [liquibase.properties](https://docs.liquibase.com/community/user-guide-5-0/what-is-the-liquibase-properties-file) file can be used for basic testing. However, it is **strongly** recommended that [environment variables](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/user-guide-5-0/what-are-liquibase-environment-variables) or a [secrets manager extension](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/user-guide-5-0/what-are-liquibase-secrets-management-extensions) be used for any scenario beyond that.

In general, Liquibase needs three pieces of information to connect to a database.

1. [JDBC URL](https://docs.liquibase.com/community/integration-guide-5-0): database connection string
1. Username: typically a service account
1. Password: typically stored within a vault

The exact information required may vary between individual database platforms. Consult [the database documentation](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/integration-guide-5-0/what-databases-are-supported-by-liquibase) for specific details.

# üî© Liquibase Secure Core Capabilities
During a typical evaluation the following features are exercised.

1. [Policy Checks](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/user-guide-5-0/what-are-policy-checks): similar to static code analysis, but geared more for database changes. Policy Checks can be customized by team, database, etc. Sample Regex and Python checks can be found [here](https://github.com/liquibase/custom_policychecks).
1. [Workflows](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/user-guide-5-0/what-is-a-flow-file): portable, database independent workflows to ensure consistency
1. [Operation Reports](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/user-guide-5-0/what-are-operation-reports): HTML reports used for auditing or troubleshooting, created and hosted on your infrastructure
1. [Structured Logging](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/user-guide-5-0/what-is-structured-logging): JSON formatted logs to feed into an observability tool for reporting (e.g., Datadog, Splunk, Grafana)
1. [DATABASECHANGELOGHISTORY table](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/user-guide-5-0/what-is-the-database-changelog-history-table): records a history of all changes Liquibase Secure makes to a database
1. [Targeted Rollback](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/user-guide-5-0/what-are-targeted-rollbacks): rollback individual changesets

Sample flow files are included in this repository.
